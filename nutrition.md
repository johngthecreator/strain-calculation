3. **Listen to Your Body:**
   - Pay attention to hunger and satiety cues. Ensure you're fueling adequately to support your training and daily activities.

4. **Meal Prep:**
   - Prepare meals and snacks in advance to stay on track and avoid the temptation of processed foods.

5. **Rest Days:**
   - On rest days, slightly reduce carbohydrate intake if activity levels are lower, but maintain protein intake to support muscle recovery.

6. **Stay Hydrated:**
   - Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of water per day, more if training intensely or in hot climates.

7. **Consult a Professional:**
   - For personalized guidance, consider consulting a registered dietitian or nutritionist, especially if you have specific health conditions or performance goals.

By following this meal plan and tailoring it to your specific preferences and training demands, you'll create a sustainable approach to weight loss while maintaining the energy and nutrients necessary for effective endurance training. Remember to adjust portions and snacks as needed to stay within your daily caloric target.
